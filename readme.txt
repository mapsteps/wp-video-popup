== Description ==
=== The best WordPress Video Lightbox Plugin! ===

**[WP Video Popup](https://wp-video-popup.com/?utm_source=repository&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wp_video_popup)** lets you add a responsive YouTube or Vimeo video lightbox to any page, post or custom post type of your website.

Add beautiful, minimalistic video lightbox popups to your WordPress website with just a few clicks & **without sacrificing performance**.

Use the shortcode 

`[wp-video-popup video="link-to-your-youtube-or-vimeo-video"]`

in your post, page, custom post type or template file to add a responsive YouTube or Vimeo video lightbox to your WordPress website.

To open the lightbox, simply add the **CSS-class**

`wp-video-popup`

to the element you wish to open/trigger the lightbox.

= GDPR Compliance =
WP Video Popup is 100% GDPR compliant. No connection to YouTube or Vimeo is established before the trigger element has been clicked.

= Page Speed & Performance =
Embedding YouTube or Vimeo videos can slow down your website. With WP Video Lightbox the video is only being loaded by the click on the trigger element for the maximum performance & fast loading speeds.

= Fully Responsive =
The WordPress video lightbox is fully responsive and adjusts to the device width & height the video is viewed on.

=== Usage ===
Example Shortcode to display a **YouTube video lightbox**:

`[wp-video-popup video="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlUKcNNmywk"]`

Example Shortcode to display a **Vimeo video lightbox**:

`[wp-video-popup video="https://vimeo.com/136696258"]`

CSS class that needs to be added to the element you want to open/trigger the video lightbox:

`wp-video-popup`

Trigger Element Example (Link):

`<a href="#" class="wp-video-popup">Play Video</a>`

---------

=== Shortcode Attributes ===

There are attributes available to add parameters to the embed-URL that’s dynamically generated from the video link provided in the shortcode.

Mute video:

`mute="1"`

Hide related YouTube videos:
Since September 2018, hiding related videos is no longer possible. Instead videos from your channel will be shown.

`hide-related="1"`

Start video at a specific time (value in seconds):

`start="24"`

Portrait mode (Vimeo only):

`portrait="1"`

Example Shortcode with shortcode attributes:

`[wp-video-popup mute="1" start="24" video="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlUKcNNmywk"]`

---------

=== Advanced ===

In addition to the shortcode attributes, there is a filter available that allows you to add more parameters to the embed-URL. By default, only the `autoplay` attribute is added to the embed-URL.

In the example below, we use the filter to remove the YouTube branding from the video by adding the `modestbranding` parameter:

`function prefix_your_custom_embed_url_attributes( $video_url ) {
	$video_url .= '&amp;modestbranding=1';
	return $video_url;
}
add_filter( 'wp_video_popup', 'prefix_your_custom_embed_url_attributes' );`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do i use this plugin? =
WP Video Popup doesn’t create an admin settings page. To trigger and display the lightbox popup, please follow the steps under **Description**.
= The video doesn't play automatically =
We add the autoplay attribute to the embed-URL by default. That being said, the video should play automatically after the trigger element has been clicked. Some browsers have changed their autoplay policy and videos only start playing if they're muted.

To mute the video, add the `mute="1"` attribute to the shortcode like this:

`[wp-video-popup mute="1" video="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlUKcNNmywk"]`
= What about private Vimeo videos =
Private vimeo videos add an extra string to the URL like this: `https://vimeo.com/xxxx/yyyy`.

When adding the URL to the shortcode, simply remove the last string so that your shortcode would look something like this: `[wp-video-popup video="https://vimeo.com/xxxx"]`.
